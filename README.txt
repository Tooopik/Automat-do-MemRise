This program downloads audio files with the articulation of English words from "Diki.pl".
It helps me create courses that I use to learn English. If you want to use it, you need to 
create a word list in Excel and export it to a .tsv file. Then put the file in the "input" folder,
the program gets the words from the second column of this file.

Currently, the program only collects data to automatically send it to Memrise.com in the future.
